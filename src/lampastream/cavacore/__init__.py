"""Python binding for upstream cavacore via ctypes.

Upstream: github.com/karlstav/cava  commit 6d43df3b2c7882122585c02c064b20009842a6f8
License:  MIT — Copyright (c) 2022 Karl Stavestrand <karl@stavestrand.no>

The native shared library (_libcavacore.so) is compiled from vendored C sources
by hatch_build.py during `pip install .`.  Import of this module does NOT raise;
call is_cavacore_available() to check whether the native library is present and
loads successfully before constructing CavaCoreBackend.

Amplitude convention
--------------------
Upstream cavacore's LINEAR scaling mode (SCALING_LINEAR=0) is calibrated for
PCM in the int16 range, approximately [-32768, 32768].  Canonical LampaStream PCM
is normalized float32 in approximately [-1.0, 1.0].  CavaCoreBackend.execute()
scales incoming samples by 32768 at the cavacore boundary; canonical PCM is
never modified.  SCALING_DECIBEL mode already divides by 32768 internally
(see cavacore.c) and is not used by LampaStream.

Execution scheduler
-------------------
execute() processes samples in deterministic 480-frame execution blocks via a
carry buffer.  Samples that do not fill a complete block are buffered and
combined with the next call's samples.  This makes output sample-count-driven
rather than call-count-driven: identical total PCM always produces identical
cavacore state regardless of incoming chunk sizes.

Stereo channel convention (matches cavacore.c buffer extraction)
----------------------------------------------------------------
cava_in interleaved as [L0, R0, L1, R1, …]
cava_out[:n_bars] = L bars, cava_out[n_bars:] = R bars

For the LampaStream integration the caller averages L+R bars after execute().

Lifecycle
---------
CavaCoreBackend.close() / context-manager usage releases the cava_plan and
FFTW memory.  close() is idempotent.  __del__ is safe even after a failed
__init__.  If cava_init() reports an error status the plan struct is freed via
cavacore_free_failed() (not cava_destroy()) to avoid freeing uninitialised
inner pointers.
