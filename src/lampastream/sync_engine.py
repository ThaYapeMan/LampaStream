"""The audio analysis and colour engine.

Signal path (one layer at a time):

    FifoReader      — reads cava's raw FIFO output in a background thread
    BandNormaliser  — AGC: normalises each bar against its own rolling average
    OnsetDetector   — spectral flux onset detection with EMA-based threshold
    CavaPipeline    — wraps the three above; produces AudioFeatures each frame
    ColourModeEffect— implements Renderer; maps AudioFeatures to a Scene using
                      one of the two active ColorMode strategies
    SyncEngine      — orchestrates AudioPipeline + Renderer + Output at 30 Hz,
                      with an optional ring-buffer delay on the output

Nothing in this module imports from hue_entertainment; all Hue-specific code
lives in hue_output.py.

class BandNormaliser:
    """Converts raw cava bar values into per-band exertion scores.

    Instead of comparing bands against each other in absolute terms (which
    lets bass dominate almost every frame because it's always energetic),
    each bar is compared against *its own recent average*:

        exertion(i) = raw[i] / rolling_average(i)

    A band that is always loud stops being interesting; it only lights up
    when it is louder than it usually is.  Mids and treble that were
    previously drowned out now get equal standing whenever they spike above
    their own baselines.

    The result is re-encoded as bytes (0-255) so it can be fed straight
    into the existing frame_to_commands() pipeline unchanged:

        exertion 0.0  → byte   0  (band well below its average)
        exertion 1.0  → byte  85  (band exactly at its average, clip=3.0)
        exertion 3.0  → byte 255  (band at three times its average, clipped)

    Three-layer loudness pipeline — how the settings interact:

    1. HERE (exertion_clip): sets what "maximally loud relative to normal"
       means in relative terms.  Default 3.0 gives headroom so constant-
       level music (exertion ≈ 1×) sits around byte 85 (≈ 33 % output)
       rather than saturating.  Lower values compress dynamic range;
       higher values give more headroom before saturation.

    2. profile.sensitivity (in ColourModeEffect.render()): a multiplier
       applied *after* normalisation.  With normalised input at ≈ 0.33,
       sens=1.0 is roughly one-third brightness steady-state; sens=2.0
       doubles that to two-thirds.  Fine-tune here.

    3. Clip at 1.0 (in ColourModeEffect.render()): safety ceiling just
       before RGB conversion.  Prevents individual channels from exceeding
       full brightness regardless of sensitivity.  Not a musical choice.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


class SuperfluxDetector:
    """SuperFlux onset detection (Böck & Widmer, 2013) with Dixon peak-picking.

    Spectral flux is computed with a maximum-filter applied over mu neighboring
    bins of the previous frame before taking the half-wave rectified difference.
    This suppresses vibrato and pitch-shifting artefacts that trigger plain
    spectral flux with false positives.

    Algorithm (from the paper):
        X_max(n, k) = max( X(n, k-mu) … X(n, k+mu) )
        SuperFlux(n) = Σ_k  H( X(n, k) − X_max(n-lag, k) )
        H = half-wave rectifier: H(x) = max(0, x)

    Böck uses mu=3 bins on a mel filterbank (~84 bands) and lag=2 frames.
    On raw FFT bins (PcmStft: 1025 bins at 21.5 Hz/bin for 44100 Hz), mu=3
    covers only ±65 Hz — less relative effect than on mel because the bin
    resolution is much finer.  Make mu configurable so users can increase it
    if more vibrato suppression is needed.

    Dixon peak-picking is applied to the SuperFlux ODF via OnsetDetector.process_odf()
    so the three conditions (local max, asymmetric mean + delta, g_alpha) are
    identical to the combined and multiband methods.

    Source: Böck & Widmer, "Maximum Filter Vibrato Suppression for Onset
    Detection", DAFx-13.  The algorithm itself is patent-free; this is an
    independent implementation from the paper.

    ------------
    A LatencyProbe is queried each tick for the current delay in milliseconds.
    Every tick appends one slot (a rendered Scene or None for silent/absent
    frames) and pops the oldest slot(s) to keep the buffer at the probe's
    target depth.  This keeps the delay time-consistent: silent gaps advance
    the buffer rather than compressing it.

    The probe defaults to NoLatencyProbe (0 ms, zero overhead).

    LMS sync master changes between polling cycles.
