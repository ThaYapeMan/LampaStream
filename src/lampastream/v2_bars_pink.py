"""V2 spectrum bars with per-band pink-noise compensation.

Standalone, self-verifying reference for the improvement to LampaStream's
V2SpectrumEngine.  It reproduces V2's exact bin→bar mapping (log-spaced bars,
np.max within each bar, squelch gate) so the compensation is derived for the
*real* layout, then adds the one piece of the WLED AudioReactive chain that V2
omitted: the per-band pink-noise compensation (WLED's ``fftResultPink[]``).

Why this exists
---------------
V2 normalises every bar against ONE global peak EMA.  Music carries far more
raw magnitude in the bass than in the mids and treble (roughly a 1/f, "pink"
tilt), so that single reference is always set by the bass bar, and mid/treble
are squashed towards zero — visible on the live system as an almost entirely
red spectrum_rgb output the moment a beat dominates.

WLED (the stated inspiration for V2) has the same global AGC but applies a
static per-band multiplier table *before* it, flattening the systematic tilt
while leaving genuine cross-band dynamics intact.  The maintainers of WLED
AudioReactive (MoonModules) state the acceptance test plainly: play pink noise
and all bars must sit at a similar level.  That test is implemented below.

WLED's table is hand-tuned for its fixed 16-band, 10 kHz layout and cannot be
copied: V2 has 10–60 bars over a user-set frequency range.  So the table is
derived here for whatever layout is configured, by pushing synthetic pink
noise through the identical mapping and inverting the per-bar response.  This
also captures a second-order effect a formula would miss: np.max over a wide
high-frequency bar is biased upward by the number of bins it spans.

What is deliberately NOT changed: np.max per bar (V2's character, and the
reason its onset feel is good), the global peak AGC (so bass-heavy music still
reads bass-heavy — just not 10× so), and the 0..1 linear output range that
downstream effects assume.  WLED's optional logarithmic output scaling is a
separate decision and is not applied here.
