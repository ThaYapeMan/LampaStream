"""Regression tests for the second-round audit blockers against 7dc457b.

Every test in this file is designed to FAIL on commit
``7dc457b9169aa0c5fd08dda1283dc7d208d4fa54`` and PASS after the fixes in
this branch.  The blockers covered:

  1. Default squeezelite build must enable ``-DVISEXPORT`` and link the
     v0 + v1 producer objects.
  2. SHM replacement remap must recover through absent/incomplete
     replacements without ever falling back to v0 under require_v1.
  3. Replace-analyser timeout must close the candidate exactly once and
     leave the runtime in a usable or explicitly deactivated state.
  4. PlayerManager.restart_cava must be transactional — a failed
     ``_start_cava`` must not corrupt session profile / runtime.
  5. Producer patch must wrap init, silence, and vis_stop transitions
     in the seqlock protocol.
  6. Processor interval publication must key by exact
     ``(sample_start, sample_end)`` — no bounding-union, no
     list-position association.
  7. CavaCoreSpectrumEngine.feed()/flush() must report correct positions
     (or be explicitly unsupported).
